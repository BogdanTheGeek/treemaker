# TreeMaker Build Status Updates

Last Updated: 2025-01-29

## Current Build Status
The project now builds successfully but has several warnings that should be addressed.

## Remaining Issues

### ~~1. Integer to Pointer Cast Warnings (High Priority)~~
~~Location: `wnmemg.c`~~
~~- Several casts from integer types to pointer types~~
~~- Potential issues on 64-bit systems~~
~~- Risk of memory corruption~~
~~- Found in macros like `WN_FREE_BLOCK_TO_MBHANDLE`~~

**FIXED**: Memory management code has been updated to be 64-bit safe:
- Replaced int with size_t for memory sizes
- Properly aligned structures using max_align_t
- Removed unsafe integer-to-pointer casts
- Added proper alignment checks
- Used flexible array members and offsetof for safe pointer arithmetic

### 2. Unsafe String Function Usage (Medium Priority)
Location: `wnasrt.c`
- Using deprecated `sprintf` function
- Security vulnerability risk
- Should be replaced with `snprintf`
- Multiple instances throughout assertion handling code

### 3. Format String Mismatches (Medium Priority)
Locations: 
- `wnrnd.c`: Mismatch between format specifier and argument type
- `wnmem.c`: Extra arguments in format string
- Need to ensure proper type matching for printf-family functions

### 4. String Literal Conversions (Low Priority)
Location: `wnmem.c`
- String literals being converted to `char*`
- Not compliant with C++11 standard
- Should be marked as `const char*`
- Affects string handling in memory management code

### 5. Deprecated Register Keyword (Low Priority)
Location: Multiple files in `wnlib`
- Using deprecated `register` storage class specifier
- Not compatible with C++17
- Style/modernization issue
- No functional impact, but should be cleaned up

## Next Steps
1. Replace unsafe string functions with secure alternatives
2. Fix format string mismatches
3. Update string literal handling for C++11 compliance
4. Remove deprecated register keywords

## Notes
- All warnings appear in the `wnlib` library code
- Most issues are related to modernizing legacy C code in a C++ environment
- No functional issues in the core TreeMaker code
